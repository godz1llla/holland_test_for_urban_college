# RIASEC Personality Test - Standalone Version

This is a standalone, portable version of the RIASEC Personality Test platform, built using only Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Zero Dependencies**: Runs directly in the browser without any framework or backend.
- **Multi-language Support**: Fully localized in English, Russian, and Kazakh.
- **URBAN COLLEGE Design**: Implements the official design system with bold aesthetics and clear structure.
- **Self-Contained Data**: All questions and profession data are embedded in JavaScript files for offline compatibility.

## How to Run
1. Open the `html/` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
   - For best results, we recommend using a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code, or `python3 -m http.server`).

## Directory Structure
- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `quiz.html`: Quiz flow (form, questions, results).
- `css/`: Styling based on URBAN COLLEGE design system.
- `js/`: Core application logic (i18n, quiz logic).
- `data/`: Extracted questions, professions, and translations.
